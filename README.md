### Minesweeper AI Agent
## CS-199 Final Project

** Author(s): Serena Nguyen, Justin Chung **

This project implements a fully autonomus Minesweeper
agent that solves any standard Minesweeper board using
frontier analysis, constraint satisfaction, and model
checking. 

Original Starter agent was debugged and extended to support
boards of arbitrary sizes and mine count; polished performance
and complete game logic.
